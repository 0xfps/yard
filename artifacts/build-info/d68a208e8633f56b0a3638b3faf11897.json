The released NFT can then be treated like any normal NFT.\n *\n *          This introduces a flaw to the design of Yard, being that NFTs are always duplicated when wrapped\n *          as a result of liquidity provision, and on the edge case of having the released wrapped NFTs\n *          have pairs with other NFTs, it implies that on provision of liquidity with a\n *          wrapped Yard NFT, the already wrapped Yard NFT will be re-wrapped again, and again\n *          and probably, again, as long as subsequent wrapped NFTs have their own pair.\n */\n\ncontract YardNFTWrapper is IYardNFTWrapper, ERC721, Ownable2Step {\n    /// @dev NFT ID counter.\n    uint256 private nftIndex;\n    /// @dev `YardFactory` address.\n    address public factory;\n\n    /// @dev A mapping of YardWrapped NFT IDs to their underlying NFT token URIs.\n    mapping(uint256 id => string URI) public tokenURIs;\n    /// @dev    Mapping of NFT ID to their release status.\n    /// @notice NFT IDs that are not released cannot be approved or transferred.\n    mapping(uint256 id => bool isReleased) public nftReleasedStatus;\n    /// @dev Addresses of pairs that are allowed to wrap NFTs.\n    mapping(address pair => bool isAllowed) public allowedPairs;\n\n    /// @dev Only allowed pair addresses are allowed to make this call.\n    modifier onlyAllowedPairs() {\n        if (!allowedPairs[msg.sender]) revert(\"YARD: ONLY_ALLOWED_PAIRS\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /// @dev Only released NFTs can proceed with this action.\n    modifier onlyReleased(uint256 id) {\n        if (!nftReleasedStatus[id]) revert(\"YARD: ONLY_RELEASED\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /// @dev Only the factory address can make this call.\n    modifier onlyFactory() {\n        if (msg.sender != factory) revert(\"YARD: ONLY_FACTORY\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /// @dev Constructor.\n    constructor() ERC721(\"Wrapped Yard NFT\", \"WyNFT\") {}\n\n    /// @notice Factory address can be set once.\n    /// @param  _factory Address of new factory address.\n    function setFactory(address _factory) public onlyOwner {\n        if (factory != address(0)) revert(\"YARD: FACTORY_SET\");\n        if (_factory == address(0)) revert(\"YARD: INVALID_ADDRESS\");\n        factory = _factory;\n    }\n\n    /**\n    * @notice   Whenever a new pair is created, the address of the pair is\n    *           added to this contract so that that pair can wrap and unwrap\n    *           NFTs on the provision and removal of liquidity respectively.\n    *           Only the factory address can make this call.\n    *\n    *           A pair cannot be removed after it has been added.\n    *\n    * @param    _pair Address of new pair.\n    */\n    function addPair(address _pair) public onlyFactory {\n        if (_pair == address(0)) revert(\"YARD: INVALID_ADDRESS\");\n        allowedPairs[_pair] = true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n    * @notice   During wrap, the token URI of the underlying NFT is set to the\n    *           ID of the returned wrap token.

@title   YardNFTWrapper\n @author  sagetony224 (@sagetony224).\n @author  fps (@0xfps). \n @dev     Yard NFT Wrapper contract.\n @notice  The Yard NFT Wrapper has a singular function of wrapping NFTs\n          by keeping their URI Metadata intact and minting an NFT with the same\n          URI to a specific address. NFTs minted to addresses are non-transferable\n          and non-approvable. This is because they represent proofs of liquidity provision\n          in a particular pair contract. If the owner of a newly minted Yard wrapped NFT\n          decides to remove liquidity, the underlying NFT that the wrapped entity represents\n          is sent back to the owner if it still exists in the pool, and the wrapped NFT is\n          burned. If the underlying NFT is no longer existent in the pool in the expectation that,\n          it has been swapped and removed from the pool, then the wrapped\n          NFT is released by calling the release() function, callable only by an approved pair\n          contract address. The released NFT can then be treated like any normal NFT.\n          This introduces a flaw to the design of Yard, being that NFTs are always duplicated when wrapped\n          as a result of liquidity provision, and on the edge case of having the released wrapped NFTs\n          have pairs with other NFTs, it implies that on provision of liquidity with a\n          wrapped Yard NFT, the already wrapped Yard NFT will be re-wrapped again, and again\n          and probably, again, as long as subsequent wrapped NFTs have their own pair."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":5356,"linearizedBaseContracts":[5356,195,112,1200,1361,1316,1966,1978,1713,4618],"name":"YardNFTWrapper","nameLocation":"1978:14:23","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"constant":false,"documentation":{"id":5043,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"2040:24:23","text":"@dev

NFTs minted to addresses are non-transferable          and non-approvable. This is because they represent proofs of liquidity provision          in a particular pair contract. If the owner of a newly minted Yard wrapped NFT          decides to remove liquidity, the underlying NFT that the wrapped entity represents          is sent back to the owner if it still exists in the pool, and the wrapped NFT is          burned. If the underlying NFT is no longer existent in the pool in the expectation that,          it has been swapped and removed from the pool, then the wrapped          NFT is released by calling the release() function, callable only by an approved pair          contract address. The released NFT can then be treated like any normal NFT.          This introduces a flaw to the design of Yard, being that NFTs are always duplicated when wrapped          as a result of liquidity provision, and on the edge case of having the released wrapped NFTs          have pairs with other NFTs, it implies that on provision of liquidity with a          wrapped Yard NFT, the already wrapped Yard NFT will be re-wrapped again, and again          and probably, again, as long as subsequent wrapped NFTs have their own pair.\",\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"src/contracts/utils/YardNFTWrapper.sol\":\"YardNFTWrapper\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1000},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x923b9774b81c1abfb992262ae7763b6e6de77b077a7180d53c6ebb7b1c8bd648\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://53445dc0431f9b45c06f567c6091da961d4087bec0010cca5bd62100fa624a38\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmNvBYpBv183czrAqNXr76E8M3LF93ouAJFeAcHfb59Rcx\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x7cdab82b437a17902683a413c86d14f512674a0710007bf44c584a2d2d3ca833\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ffe4db7a9f3cdd5a5d019462c2859f4f98f7aae08704afdcb3ef0d08d966bbeb\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTCHSuoi22dAu55qv4TcENyTmv5mTpAoxmYWD8cRnEp3M\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe986ce7671ef4d92b15c9787b48f6cd6688913e8bf595ebc9c094efd8594b7c4\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://490a886c899c11eae93a3d45cfc071058d7009885b645ff552c302aed0b4abbf\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qma5gTgcbZ4BJjJMWPFDw5c7a6BDDJhUgMF2ShHazNeP2f\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x41bbb2c41036ca64b2f6c9e973e8cfaa113ebc42af86702cd0d267f915a7e886\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6bf6699c55e82c7af6ae90b61ea9643ca0c905097da9a31269319f1b5a2a696a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRJZa2UmWcRo6W8JnuomwzfjVtAS21QC8HKggxBhoPsU4\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa82b58eca1ee256be466e536706850163d2ec7821945abd6b4778cfb3bee37da\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6e75cf83beb757b8855791088546b8337e9d4684e169400c20d44a515353b708\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYvPafLfoquiDMEj7CKHtvbgHu7TJNPSVPSCjrtjV8HjV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x75b829ff2f26c14355d1cba20e16fe7b29ca58eb5fef665ede48bc0f9c6c74b9\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://a0a107160525724f9e1bbbab031defc2f298296dd9e331f16a6f7130cec32146\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmemujxSd7gX8A9M8UwmNbz4Ms3U9FG9QfudUgxwvTmPWf\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa6dfb97ce947b7c846b054ee7d45d12383359778f4f3743654ae0a34fa421b26\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b97e7e5a77ea47c08ba422291df887eba76c80982f52a6e94a30106e9377a94f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qme7N2XRC7mcDxB8wZxNWPk6T8S2qsnmhAqXeUj4CNvsGD\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe2e337e6dde9ef6b680e07338c493ebea1b5fd09b43424112868e9cc1706bca7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6df0ddf21ce9f58271bdfaa85cde98b200ef242a05a3f85c2bc10a8294800a92\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRK2Y5Yc6BK7tGKkgsgn3aJEQGi5aakeSPZvS65PV8Xp3\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x2626d8ab3dfdad0fad630c212ad146d59473d0f48b771784c61a7c1dbbea1f3f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://d7c144532f1e7c76ac95fb6a8f617c1f740d7a73442a907eb60910e99dfa1fbf\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZsGyooD6emxB8JCuugRjnRYS2MPZEL586uuV7dgC8Jng\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd10975de010d89fd1c78dc5e8a9a7e7f496198085c151648f20cba166b32582b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fb0048dee081f6fffa5f74afc3fb328483c2a30504e94a0ddd2a5114d731ec4d\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZptt1nmYoA5SgjwnSgWqgUSDgm4q52Yos3xhnMv3MV43\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xbaf3bd8c64ac943fafde717797ee797c96360586b9448ea25e9872490a6e6858\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://bab65b9b5ea0c68e96e1a73460db616042f639d144a6a75595434cfa2a483ed4\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmUgwEcWXaEu4VSpymiVq8tZYKgA44HPMWZowpg2L8Kiij\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SignedMath.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf92515413956f529d95977adc9b0567d583c6203fc31ab1c23824c35187e3ddc\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c50fcc459e49a9858b6d8ad5f911295cb7c9ab57567845a250bf0153f84a95c7\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcEW85JRzvDkQggxiBBLVAasXWdkhEysqypj9EaB6H2g6\"]},\"src/contracts/interfaces/IYardNFTWrapper.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8498601c6ce52b76cb4730bf41e144bd91bfa18449f9872aa7d653569497fd0e\",\"license\":\"GPL-3.0\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5e259c47f3cb9a13477c7dde7569bff42038aee71d02ffca88be11b7b6e77c55\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmW1N2Cps587wEi9mzukwDCLBu5yjuMQjU6VSrqCUZR2yA\"]},\"src/contracts/utils/YardNFTWrapper.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x03f5364e1cc7e6f632f7e647b371e869f66aed148d819d30e40f745497c3776f\",\"license\":\"GPL-3.0\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://61852ec9c2113e02c8fae859100e9ba80e2c64d6439f047d553603e3ea54d336\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmNbx7Aqdmq1yhF92Y1FHt69gJwKQiqNKVEw5n3hDK6vzK\"]}},\"version\":1}"}}}}}
